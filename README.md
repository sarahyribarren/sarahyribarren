- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarahyribarren
- 👀 I’m interested in synthetic biology and biodesign professionally, but I also have a deep interest in philosophy and ethics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bioengineering towards a degree at Stanford, along with an Ethics in Society minor. 
    Additionally, I'm trying to learn Mandarin Chinese, which is as difficult at everyone says it is. 
    <br>Coding is a side hobby that I picked up because building websites is fun!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a website that acts as a social media hub for Synthetic Biology. 
    Called the "SynBiome" it would be made up of different sub-communities in the synthetic biology field to talk about ideas, share papers and articles,
    connect with like-minded people, and collaborate on research projects across the world. 
- 📫 Contact me at 'sarahyri@stanford.edu' if you're interested in working with me on the "SynBiome" website!
